Don't worry about keeping the buttons in place, I'll redo the image maps later.
    Also try to centre the buttons, mine aren't at all centred.

Add in a consistently placed back button and options menu button.

Make sure the images are either the same resolution, or an integer multiple of that resolution (2x, 3x, etc.)

A lot of stuff needs to be rendered using html/css because it contains generated content (like the user's name and stuff) so there aren't images for them

Feel free to add images where there are none. We can have images in the background of pages as well.
    eg. the profile page has no images (other than user-images and ones it steals from badges)
