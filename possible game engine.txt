A few musings on things. should really only be done once we get a working app.

user records most and total(kills, days, searches, fight, and retreats), as well as savestate

party members get a generated name(maybe a list of 100 fore and surnames), and for both stats a random number from 1-5
party should also keep a reference of it's size, and the total accuracy and speed in it.

change the win alg to  25% +50%(if ammo) +1%(per acc point) -1%(per zombie) -2%(per zombie over party size) -5%(per party size over ammo)

run 50% +1%(per speed)-2%(per party size) -1%(per zombie)

badges unlock at certain thresholds.
