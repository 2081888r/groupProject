/zombie/login/				= Used to log in (then shows the main page or index page)
/zombie/logout/				= Used to log out (then shows the index page)
/zombie/register/			= Used to register (then shows the index page)
/zombie/profile/username/		= Username's profile overview (badges/friends/scores)
/zombie/profile/username/badges/	= Username's badges page
/zombie/profile/username/friends/	= Username's friends page
/zombie/leaderboard/			= The global leaderboard
/zombie/game/				= The actual game
